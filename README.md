Hi, I’m @Beksh44 I’m currently learning machine learning/computer engineering. Currently doing a project of chess on a python language using tkinter library for frontend. Planing on making game mode for two players to play on a same pc and game mode versus a simple ai,which i hope will be at the level of 300-400 elo. Good luck for me
